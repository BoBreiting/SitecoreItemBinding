SitecoreItemBinding
===================

The main purpose of the ItemBinding framework is to eliminate the repetitive code that is usually required to interact with Sitecore when creating model classes for representing item data. Also it is intended to standardize the code associated with interacting with Sitecore item data and model classes to instantly recognize and understand how the various parts of a solution works by using common code patterns. Lastly centralizing the item-to-model binding removes the errors that would normally be scattered throughout the solution and ensures that if any errors are found they can be corrected centrally.

The framework also offers a standardized methodology for ensuring that the items that are bound to the model classes complies to the requirements set by the model classes through the use of an extensible set of binding contracts not unlike the data contracts featured in the .NET framework.
